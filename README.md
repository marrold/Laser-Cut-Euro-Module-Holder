# Laser Cut Euro Module Holder
I have a couple of projects in the pipeline that will use Euro Modules to expose various connectors on a panel, however the existing 1 and 2 gang Euro Module plates take up unnecessary space. To save space I've created laser cut module holders which can be adapted as required.

## Assembly

- Cut the rear mount out of 4mm acrylic with a laser cutter (It *must* be 4mm as thats the correct size for the clips)
- Cut the front plate out of acrylic - thickness is less critical. 5mm will give you an almost flush end result. 
- Insert the modules into the back plate
- Push the front plate onto the back plate to secure the modules
- Attach to your panel
